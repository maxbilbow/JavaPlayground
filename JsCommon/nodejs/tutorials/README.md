# JS Tutorials

To run these tutorials, you will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
Ideally, you will also have a JavaScript debugger in your IDE so that you can stop and investigate on breakpoints

## Preamble
These tutorials should help avoid some pretty common traps.

They are designed to cover some very basic ES5 and ES6 phenomena.
